# The Serpent's Sentence

A book exploring how language fractured human consciousness and how AI represents a second, equally profound cognitive explosion.

## Project Overview

This is a document-driven book project examining the thesis that humanity's invention of language was both our greatest leap and our "fall"—an event that exiled us from unified consciousness. Today, AI marks a second transformation, and understanding our linguistic exile can help us navigate this new era as architects of a hybrid human-AI future.

## Workflow

1. **Research**: Capture atomic notes in `notes/tier1-raw/`
2. **Organize**: Cluster by themes in `notes/tier2-clusters/`
3. **Construct**: Build chapter arguments in `notes/tier3-chapters/`
4. **Draft**: Write chapters in `drafts/`

## Status

Planning and research phase. No codebase - this is a document-driven narrative project.
