# The Serpent's Sentence

This project is a document-driven book/narrative exploring the cognitive and existential impact of language and AI. All essential knowledge is scaffolded in:

- `Synopsis.txt`: High-level concept, themes, and goals
- `.github/Detailed Chapter Outline.md`: Chapter-by-chapter structure and narrative flow
- `.github/Research Outline.md`: Research sources, key thinkers, and interdisciplinary connections
- `.github/Guide.md`: Distilled thesis, target audience, voice, and unique selling proposition
- `.github/A Three-Tier Note-Taking System.md`: Research and writing workflow
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: Guidance for AI coding agents

## Workflow

- Begin by reading all key files above.
- Use the note-taking system to capture, cluster, and construct arguments and chapters.
- Align all generated content with the themes, structure, research, thesis, and voice outlined in the key files.
- Update documentation as the project evolves.

## Status

No codebase or build system yet. This is a planning and research-first project.
