A Three-Tier Note-Taking System
This system is designed to capture, connect, and then construct.

Tier 1: The Raw Material (The "Dredge Net")
This is the foundational layer. Your goal here is to capture ideas without immediate judgment or organization.

Method: Use a system that allows for atomic notes—one core idea per note. Digital tools like Obsidian or Roam Research are excellent for this because they use linking, but physical index cards work just as well.

Content of Each Note:

The Idea: A single direct quote, a paraphrased concept, or a statistic.

The Source: A precise citation (Author, Book, Page Number / URL). This is non-negotiable.

Your Reflection (Crucial): A sentence or two on why this is interesting to you. How does it connect to the book's thesis? What questions does it raise? This is where your unique voice begins to emerge.

Tier 2: The Thematic Cluster (The "Sorting Table")
This is the organizational layer. As you create raw notes, you'll tag them with the core themes of the book. These tags should correspond to your central metaphors and arguments, not just the chapter titles.

Key Tags to Start With:

#Eden (pre-linguistic consciousness, unity, flow states)

#TheFall (language acquisition, division, categorization)

#NarratorSelf (the "I" pronoun, the Default Mode Network, alienation)

#CambrianExplosion (generativity of language, myth, ideology as predation)

#AI_Exile (postlapsarian nature of AI, non-embodied intelligence)

#TrilobiteOrFish (human obsolescence vs. adaptation)

#Symbiosis (human-AI integration, new forms of consciousness)

A single note—for instance, a quote from Daniel Dennett—might get tagged with both #NarratorSelf and #TrilobiteOrFish. This system allows you to see the powerful connections between different fields of research.

Tier 3: The Chapter Argument (The "Blueprint")
This is the constructive layer, where you begin to build the book itself.

Method: Create a separate document for each chapter as outlined previously.

Process: When you're ready to start thinking about Chapter 3 ("The Prison of the Pronoun"), you can simply pull up all your notes tagged with #NarratorSelf.

Action: Review this curated collection of quotes, ideas, and reflections. Arrange them into a logical sequence that forms the backbone of the chapter's argument. You will see gaps you need to fill and connections you hadn't anticipated. This becomes the detailed outline from which you will write the first draft.
