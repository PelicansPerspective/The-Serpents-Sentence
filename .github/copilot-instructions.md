## Project Overview
This is an academic book project: "The Serpent's Sentence: Language, Consciousness, and the Second Cambrian Mind" by Justin T. Bogner. The project has evolved from planning to active manuscript development with LaTeX infrastructure and comprehensive research foundation.

**Core Architecture:**
- `Synopsis.txt` — foundational concept and thesis
- `.github/Detailed Chapter Outline.md` — complete chapter structure
- `.github/Research Outline.md` — academic sources and research methodology  
- `.github/Guide.md` — voice, audience, and unique selling proposition
- `main.tex` + `introduction.tex` — complete LaTeX manuscript ready for Overleaf
- `notes/ai-research/source-summaries/` — comprehensive neuroscience research foundation

## Current State: Active Manuscript Development
The project has moved beyond planning into manuscript development:

**LaTeX Infrastructure (Ready for Overleaf):**
- `main.tex`: Professional book-class document with frontmatter/mainmatter/backmatter structure
- `introduction.tex`: Complete 4-5 page introduction synthesizing research into accessible narrative
- Chicago author-date citation style, double-spacing, professional formatting

**Research Foundation:**
- `notes/ai-research/source-summaries/`: Six comprehensive neuroscience research files covering Default Mode Network, Left-Brain Interpreter, embodied cognition, predictive processing
- Research directly supports book's thesis about language as cognitive "Fall" and AI as "Second Cambrian Explosion"

## AI Agent Workflow
1. **Always read core files first:** `Synopsis.txt`, chapter outline, research outline, and guide
2. **For manuscript work:** Reference `notes/ai-research/source-summaries/` for academic support
3. **For LaTeX editing:** Use `replace_string_in_file` with 3-5 lines context, maintain professional formatting
4. **New research:** Add to appropriate `notes/` subdirectory with clear academic documentation
5. **Git commits:** Use detailed academic commit messages documenting research significance

## Key Patterns
- **Tone:** Philosophically rigorous yet accessible, personal and exploratory
- **Research Integration:** Academic sources support thesis, tagged with themes (#Eden, #TheFall, #NarratorSelf)
- **Documentation:** All changes documented with detailed commit messages explaining academic relevance
- **LaTeX Conventions:** Book-class, Chicago citations, double-spacing, professional chapter formatting

## Current Development Priority
Focus on expanding individual chapter content within established LaTeX framework, using neuroscience research foundation to support philosophical arguments about language, consciousness, and AI symbiosis.

## Research Methodology Patterns
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Each research file covers 15-20 major concepts with academic depth
- **Cross-Disciplinary Integration:** Connect neuroscience, philosophy, AI, and evolutionary research
- **Thesis Alignment:** Every research point explicitly connected to book's central arguments
- **Academic Sourcing:** Include specific researchers, papers, and theoretical frameworks
- **Practical Applications:** Show relevance to AI development and human-AI interaction

## Recent Research Expansion (August 2025)
- `evolutionary-linguistics-research.md`: Language evolution, gesture-first hypothesis, archaeological evidence
- `phenomenology-consciousness-research.md`: Continental philosophy, Eastern traditions, altered states research  
- `ai-consciousness-research.md`: LLMs, consciousness theories, human-AI symbiosis possibilities
