# Copilot Instructions for The-Serpents-Sentence

## Project Overview
This repository is a book/narrative project in the planning and research phase. The architecture is document-driven, with all essential knowledge in:
- `Synopsis.txt` — high-level concept, themes, and goals
- `.github/Detailed Chapter Outline.md` — chapter-by-chapter structure and narrative flow
- `.github/Research Outline.md` — research sources, key thinkers, and interdisciplinary connections
- `.github/Guide.md` — distilled thesis, target audience, voice, and unique selling proposition

## Immediate Guidance for AI Agents
- **Primary Sources:** Always read all four files above before generating content, code, or documentation.
- **No Codebase Yet:** There are no source files, build scripts, or tests. Do not assume any programming language or workflow.
- **No Existing Conventions:** No project-specific rules, patterns, or integrations are present.
- **No External Dependencies:** No integrations or dependencies are present.

## Actionable Steps for AI Agents
1. **Start by reading `Synopsis.txt`, `.github/Detailed Chapter Outline.md`, `.github/Research Outline.md`, and `.github/Guide.md`** to understand the project's goals, structure, research, thesis, and intended voice.
2. **Align all generated content** (prose, code, documentation) with the themes, structure, research, thesis, and voice outlined in these files.
3. **When generating narrative, match the tone: philosophically rigorous, personal, and exploratory. Address the "intellectually curious" audience as described in `.github/Guide.md`.**
4. **If new files or directories are created, document their purpose and structure in this file.**
5. **Update this file as the project evolves** to reflect new conventions, workflows, or architectural decisions.

## Example
- If asked to generate a chapter draft, use the structure and themes from `.github/Detailed Chapter Outline.md`, support claims with sources from `.github/Research Outline.md`, and match the thesis and voice from `.github/Guide.md`.
- If new code or documentation is added, update this file to describe the architecture, workflows, and conventions as they emerge.
