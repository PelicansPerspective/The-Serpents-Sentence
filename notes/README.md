# Research Notes

This directory organizes research according to the Three-Tier Note-Taking System outlined in `.github/A Three-Tier Note-Taking System.md`.

## Structure

- `tier1-raw/` - Raw material capture (atomic notes, one idea per file)
- `tier2-clusters/` - Thematic organization by tags (#Eden, #TheFall, #NarratorSelf, etc.)
- `tier3-chapters/` - Chapter-specific argument construction
- `ai-research/` - AI-generated research notes and analysis

## Workflow

1. **Tier 1**: Capture atomic notes with source citations and personal reflections
2. **Tier 2**: Tag and organize by thematic clusters  
3. **Tier 3**: Build detailed chapter arguments using curated collections
4. **AI Research**: AI agents assist with literature reviews, concept mapping, and source analysis

See `.github/A Three-Tier Note-Taking System.md` for complete methodology.
