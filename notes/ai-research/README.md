# AI Research Notes

This directory contains research notes generated by AI agents to support the book project. These complement the human research workflow but follow the same three-tier methodology.

## Purpose

AI agents can help with:
- Literature reviews and source identification
- Concept mapping and connection finding
- Summarizing academic papers and books
- Identifying research gaps
- Cross-referencing themes across disciplines

## Structure

- `literature-reviews/` - Comprehensive reviews of key sources
- `concept-maps/` - Visual/textual maps of idea relationships
- `source-summaries/` - Atomic summaries of papers, books, articles
- `thematic-analysis/` - Deep dives into specific themes
- `research-gaps/` - Identified areas needing further investigation

## Integration with Human Research

AI research notes should:
- Reference sources from `.github/Research Outline.md`
- Use the same tagging system (#Eden, #TheFall, #NarratorSelf, etc.)
- Complement rather than replace human reflection and insight
- Be clearly marked as AI-generated for transparency

## Workflow

1. **Request**: Human specifies research target or question
2. **Generate**: AI produces structured research notes
3. **Review**: Human evaluates and integrates findings
4. **Tag**: Apply thematic tags for clustering with human notes
5. **Reference**: Use in tier3 chapter argument construction
