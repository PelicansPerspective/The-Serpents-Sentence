# Private Repository Strategy - Website Options

You're absolutely correct! Your repository contains:
- Complete 87-page manuscript 
- Proprietary research notes
- Academic source materials
- Detailed chapter outlines

Making this public would expose all your intellectual property. Here are better options:

## Option 1: Separate Public Website Repository ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

Create a NEW public repository just for your website:

### Setup Steps:
1. Create new repository: `JustinTBogner-Website` (or similar)
2. Make it PUBLIC 
3. Copy only the website files (no manuscript content)
4. Enable GitHub Pages on the new repo

### What Gets Public:
- Professional author website
- Book description (not full content)
- Speaking topics
- Contact information
- General insights/quotes

### What Stays Private:
- Full manuscript
- Research notes  
- Chapter outlines
- Academic sources
- All proprietary content

## Option 2: Static Website Hosting Services

Deploy your website to:
- **Netlify** (free tier, easy deployment)
- **Vercel** (free for personal use)  
- **GitHub Pages** from a separate public repo
- **WordPress.com** (free subdomain)

## Option 3: Professional Domain + Hosting

- Register `JustinTBogner.com`
- Use hosting like Bluehost, SiteGround, etc.
- Upload just the website files
- Full control over content and branding

## Immediate Action Plan

I'll create a separate website-only package that includes:
- Clean website files
- No manuscript content
- Professional author platform
- Links to "contact for manuscript review"

This protects your IP while establishing your professional presence.

Would you like me to:
1. Create a website-only package for separate deployment?
2. Set up instructions for a new public repository?
3. Provide alternative hosting options?
