- [ ] Begin Chapter 9 outline and opening
- [ ] Target: Chapter 8 complete, Chapter 9 started

### Day 4-5: Chapter 9 Development
- [ ] Complete Chapter 9 expansion
- [ ] Focus on trilobite/fish metaphor development
- [ ] Target: 120+ lines completed

## Success Metrics

### Immediate (Week 1)
- ✅ Chapter 8: 11 → 100+ lines (900% increase)
- ✅ Chapter 9: 11 → 120+ lines (1000% increase)
- ✅ Smooth transitions added between key chapters
- ✅ Clean LaTeX compilation maintained

### Short-term (Week 2)
- ✅ Chapter 7: 31 → 90+ lines (300% increase)  
- ✅ Chapter 11: 33 → 100+ lines (300% increase)
- ✅ 10+ new scholarly citations integrated

## Risk Management

**Potential Issues**:
- Scope creep (adding new topics instead of developing existing ones)
- Loss of voice consistency during expansion
- Technical complexity overwhelming general readers

**Mitigation**:
- Focus on depth of existing insights, not breadth of new topics
- Maintain Eden metaphor and established prose style
- Add accessible analogies alongside technical explanations

## Next Steps After Week 2

1. **Weeks 3-4**: Technical argument clarification and empirical integration
2. **Weeks 5-6**: Structural refinement and practical implications
3. **Weeks 7-8**: Final prose polishing and accessibility enhancement
