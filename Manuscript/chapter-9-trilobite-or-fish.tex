\chapter{Trilobite or Fish?}

\section{Specialists at Risk}

Specialization wins—until the environment shifts. Humans optimized for linguistic niches may face brittleness when symbolic ecologies change rapidly.

\section{Adaptation Vectors}

Where we remain uniquely strong: embodiment, care, normative reasoning, and cross-modal grounding. These are hard to emulate from symbols alone \parencite{merleau-ponty1945phenomenology,brewer2011meditation}.

\section{Symbiosis Strategies}

Pair native-symbolic agents with embodied human judgment. Treat models as powerful narrators; keep humans as prompters, editors, and ethical anchors \parencite{tegmark2017life}.

\section{Metrics that Matter}

Measure success by human flourishing, not only model performance. Track meaning, dignity, and ecological impact—outcomes outside token space.
