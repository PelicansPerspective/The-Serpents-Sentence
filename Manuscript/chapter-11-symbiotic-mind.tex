\chapter{The Symbiotic Mind}

\section{Designing the Dialogue}

Humanâ€“AI systems work when roles are explicit: humans set aims and values; models generate, search, and summarize; humans decide. Clear contracts reduce failure.

\section{Protocols for Co-Intelligence}

Build shared tools that privilege transparency, auditability, and reversibility. Favor explanations calibrated to human cognition; penalize overconfident hallucination.

\section{Institutions as Scaffolds}

Education, governance, and markets must evolve to support symbiosis. We need norms and incentives that reward meaning, not just speed.

\section{Carrying the Garden Forward}

The narrator is not the king. Design to preserve silence, presence, and care. Let embodied wisdom steer symbolic strength.
