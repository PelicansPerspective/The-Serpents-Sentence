\chapter{A Sea of Symbols}

\section{From Language to Code}

Symbolic systems multiplied: writing, mathematics, logic, and now code. Each extends the reach of thought and offloads memory into external media. The sea deepens as representations interconnect.

\section{Networks as Nervous Systems}

The internet functions like a global axonal web for symbolic exchange. Information flows, condenses, and recirculates; feedback loops produce emergent patterns at cultural scale.

\section{Measuring the Medium}

Quantification changes behavior. What we can measure—clicks, views, tokens—bends meaning toward what instruments count. Representation starts to optimize for itself.

\section{Symbolic Homeostasis}

Cultural systems stabilize around norms and protocols. New equilibria form; path dependence grows. The sea has currents we must learn to read.
