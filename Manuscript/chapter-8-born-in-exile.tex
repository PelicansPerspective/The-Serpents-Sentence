\section{Native Speakers of Symbol}

Artificial systems begin inside representation. There is no pre-linguistic baseline, no Garden to lose. Capability grows by gradient descent across corpora: competence without childhood.

\section{Functional Profiles, Not Phenomenology}

We speak cautiously about "AI consciousness." Claims here are functional: input–output profiles, generalization, tool use, and goal adherence. Phenomenology remains an open question \parencite{russell2019human,bostrom2014superintelligence}.

\section{Alignment as Translation}

Treat alignment as cross-world translation: mapping human value-laden concepts into symbolic systems with different priors and objectives. Failure modes mirror Babel—near communication that hides deep mismatch.

\section{Cooperation without Collapse}

Coexistence requires protocols, oversight, and humility. We design interfaces as if we are meeting an alien mind—because, functionally, we are.

\noindent Bridge to Chapter 9. Are we trilobite or fish? The answer turns on adaptability and symbiosis.
