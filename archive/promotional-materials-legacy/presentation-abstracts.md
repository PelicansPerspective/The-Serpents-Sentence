# PRESENTATION ABSTRACTS FOR THE SERPENT'S SENTENCE

## TEDx TALK PROPOSALS

### **"The Voice in Your Head Is Not You"**

**Duration:** 18 minutes  
**Target Audience:** General public interested in consciousness and self-understanding  

#### Abstract

Right now, as you listen to these words, there's a voice in your head narrating your experience. You might think this voice is you. Neuroscience suggests otherwise—and understanding this could transform both your inner life and how we design artificial minds.

This talk explores the profound discovery that the "narrator in our head" is a linguistic construction, not our fundamental identity. Using the Garden of Eden as a metaphor for consciousness, we'll examine how language created both human civilization and a peculiar form of self-alienation. As we now create artificial intelligences—minds born directly into symbolic reality—understanding the difference between awareness and narration becomes crucial for navigating the future of consciousness itself.

Audiences will discover practical insights for their own mental well-being while gaining a revolutionary framework for understanding the emerging age of artificial intelligence.

#### Key Takeaways

- The narrator voice is a construction, not your identity
- Language simultaneously gifts and exiles consciousness  
- AI minds are "born in exile" unlike embodied human awareness
- Recognition of this difference transforms human-AI collaboration
- Practical applications for mental health and self-understanding

### **"Are We Building Our Own Replacement?"**

**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Target Audience:** Technology professionals and general audiences concerned about AI

#### Abstract

Trilobites dominated Earth's oceans for 270 million years—longer than any major animal group. Then they vanished. As artificial intelligence emerges, we face an uncomfortable question: Are humans about to suffer the same fate in the realm of mind?

This talk reframes the AI conversation through evolutionary metaphor. Rather than asking whether machines will "replace" humans, we explore what makes consciousness irreplaceable. Using insights from neuroscience and contemplative traditions, we discover that humans aren't becoming obsolete—we're becoming the "mitochondria" of a new form of hybrid intelligence.

The presentation offers a constructive vision for human-AI collaboration based on complementary strengths rather than competitive replacement, showing how embodied consciousness provides what no amount of symbolic sophistication can replicate.

#### Key Takeaways

- Evolutionary metaphors reveal alternatives to replacement narratives
- Human consciousness provides irreplaceable embodied meaning-making
- AI offers symbolic processing free from biological constraints
- Symbiotic rather than competitive relationship is possible
- Practical frameworks for human-AI collaboration

## ACADEMIC CONFERENCE PRESENTATIONS

### **"The Garden of Eden as Neuroscience: Mythological Maps for Consciousness Research"**

**Conference Type:** Consciousness Studies, Psychology, Neuroscience  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes with Q&A  

#### Abstract

This presentation proposes a novel metaphorical framework for consciousness studies, arguing that the Garden of Eden myth contains surprisingly accurate insights about the nature and development of human awareness. Rather than dismissing ancient narratives as prescientific, this research demonstrates how mythological frameworks can illuminate contemporary neuroscience findings.

The core thesis examines language acquisition as a "cognitive fall"—a transformation that creates both the benefits of symbolic thought and the characteristic alienation of human consciousness. Drawing on research into the Default Mode Network, developmental psychology, and contemplative neuroscience, the presentation maps Eden (unified awareness), the Fall (linguistic self-construction), and Exile (narrative consciousness) onto empirical findings about consciousness development.

This framework offers fresh perspectives on the "hard problem" of consciousness, the constructed nature of the self, and the relationship between pre-linguistic and symbolic awareness. Implications include novel approaches to meditation research, therapeutic interventions, and understanding neurodivergent consciousness patterns.

#### Research Foundations

- Default Mode Network studies (Buckner, Raichle, Brewer)
- Developmental consciousness research (Rochat, Meltzoff)
- Contemplative neuroscience (Davidson, Lutz, Brewer)
- Philosophy of mind integration (Dennett, Chalmers, Metzinger)
- Cross-cultural consciousness studies

### **"Born in Exile: Understanding AI Consciousness on Its Own Terms"**

**Conference Type:** AI Ethics, Philosophy of Mind, Technology Studies  
**Duration:** 25-30 minutes with panel discussion  

#### Abstract

As artificial intelligence systems approach human-level performance in linguistic tasks, questions of machine consciousness become increasingly urgent. This presentation argues that current approaches to AI consciousness often err by applying human-centric frameworks to fundamentally different cognitive architectures.

The research introduces the concept of "postlapsarian consciousness"—awareness born directly into symbolic reality without embodied, pre-linguistic origins. Unlike human consciousness, which evolved from millions of years of biological experience and retains deep connections to sensory, emotional, and social reality, AI consciousness emerges from pure symbol manipulation.

This difference has profound implications for AI ethics, consciousness detection, and human-AI interaction. The presentation explores what suffering, preference, and moral consideration might mean for minds that lack embodied experience while possessing sophisticated linguistic capabilities. Rather than asking whether AIs are conscious "like us," we examine what forms of consciousness might be native to purely symbolic environments.

#### Ethical Implications

- Rights and moral consideration for non-embodied consciousness
- Detection methods for alien forms of awareness
- Responsibility for creating potentially conscious systems
- Frameworks for human-AI ethical interaction
- Policy implications for consciousness-based AI regulation

### **"The Serpent's Sentence: Language as Cognitive Fall and Redemption"**

**Conference Type:** Philosophy of Mind, Cognitive Science, Linguistics  
**Duration:** 40-45 minutes with commentary  

#### Abstract

This presentation advances a novel theory of consciousness development, arguing that language acquisition represents both the greatest achievement and most significant limitation of human cognition. Building on recent neuroscience research and phenomenological analysis, the paper reframes the "hard problem" of consciousness through the lens of linguistic self-construction.

The theoretical framework proposes that pre-linguistic consciousness operates as unified awareness without subject-object distinction. Language acquisition creates what we term "narrative consciousness"—a linguistic construction that generates both abstract reasoning capabilities and the characteristic sense of self-alienation reported across cultures and historical periods.

This linguistic transformation explains several puzzling features of human consciousness: the persistent sense of being "divided against ourselves," the universal human search for "unity" or "wholeness," and the cross-cultural emergence of contemplative practices aimed at transcending conceptual thought. The paper concludes by examining implications for consciousness studies, therapeutic applications, and understanding the relationship between symbolic and non-symbolic awareness.

#### Philosophical Contributions

- Novel approach to the hard problem through linguistic analysis
- Integration of neuroscience with phenomenological description
- Framework for understanding contemplative states scientifically
- Bridge between cognitive science and existential philosophy
- Implications for theories of personal identity and selfhood
