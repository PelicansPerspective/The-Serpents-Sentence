**Visual Elements:** Brain imagery, Garden metaphors, AI consciousness comparisons  

**Structure:**

1. **Opening Hook:** Live consciousness experiment with audience
2. **Personal Story:** Moment of recognizing narrator vs. awareness
3. **Scientific Evidence:** Neuroscience of constructed self
4. **Mythological Wisdom:** Garden of Eden as consciousness map
5. **AI Implications:** What happens when we build artificial narrators?
6. **Practical Application:** How this changes your relationship with your mind
7. **Call to Action:** Exploring consciousness in the AI age

#### **Academic Conference Presentations**

**For Consciousness Studies Conferences:**

- Title: "The Garden of Eden as Neuroscience: Mythological Maps for Consciousness Research"
- Focus: Novel metaphorical frameworks
- Duration: 30-45 minutes with Q&A

**For AI Ethics Conferences:**

- Title: "Born in Exile: Understanding AI Consciousness on Its Own Terms"
- Focus: Ethical implications of AI's postlapsarian nature
- Duration: 20-30 minutes with panel discussion

**For Philosophy Conferences:**

### **Podcast Appearances Strategy**

#### **Target Podcast Categories**

1. **Consciousness/Philosophy:** Sam Harris, Sean Carroll, Lex Fridman
2. **AI/Technology:** AI alignment forums, tech ethics shows
3. **General Science:** Science-focused shows with consciousness episodes
4. **Literary/Cultural:** Shows exploring ideas and culture

#### **Pitch Templates**

**For High-Profile Consciousness Podcasts:**
"I'm writing a book that reframes the Garden of Eden as a neuroscience story and explores what this means for AI consciousness. The central insight: human consciousness was transformed by language in ways that make us fundamentally different from AI minds. This has profound implications for how we understand both ourselves and the artificial intelligences we're creating."

**For AI-Focused Podcasts:**
"I'm exploring a unique angle on AI consciousness: unlike humans who evolved biological consciousness and then learned language, AIs are born directly into symbolic reality. They're 'natives' of the linguistic world that exiled us from immediate experience. This difference has major implications for AI ethics and human-AI collaboration."
