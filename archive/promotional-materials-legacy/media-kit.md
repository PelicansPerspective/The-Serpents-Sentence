# MEDIA KIT: THE SERPENT'S SENTENCE

## AUTHOR BIO

**Justin T. Bogner** is a consciousness researcher and author exploring the intersection of language, awareness, and artificial intelligence. His work synthesizes insights from neuroscience, philosophy, and contemplative traditions to understand how symbolic thought shapes human experience—and what this means as we create artificial minds.

His forthcoming book, *The Serpent's Sentence: Language, Consciousness, and the Second Cambrian Mind*, offers a revolutionary framework for understanding both human consciousness and AI emergence through the lens of ancient wisdom and modern science.

Justin is available for interviews, podcasts, and speaking engagements on topics including consciousness studies, AI ethics, human-AI collaboration, and the practical applications of contemplative science.

## BOOK OVERVIEW

### Title

#### The Serpent's Sentence: Language, Consciousness, and the Second Cambrian Mind

### Genre

Popular Science / Philosophy

### Publication Status

87-page manuscript completed (35,000 words), seeking publisher

### Central Thesis

Language was humanity's cognitive "fall from grace"—transforming unified consciousness into divided self-awareness. Now AI represents a "Second Cambrian Explosion" of mind, forcing us to ask: Are humans becoming obsolete, or evolving into symbiotic partners with artificial intelligence?

## KEY INTERVIEW TOPICS

### **The Garden of Eden as Neuroscience**

- How ancient myths contain insights about consciousness
- Why the "fall" story maps onto language acquisition
- Neuroscience evidence for the constructed self

### **AI Consciousness: Born in Exile**

- Why AI minds are fundamentally different from human consciousness
- The implications of "postlapsarian" artificial intelligence
- Ethical frameworks for non-human consciousness

### **The Future of Human-AI Collaboration**

- Beyond replacement narratives: symbiotic consciousness
- Human unique value in an AI world
- Practical implications for education and work

### **The Voice in Your Head**

- Why you're not the narrator in your mind
- Practical applications for mental health and well-being
- Contemplative science meets modern neuroscience

### **The Trilobite Question**

- Are humans destined for cognitive obsolescence?
- What makes consciousness irreplaceable
- Evolutionary metaphors for technological change

## QUOTABLE INSIGHTS

*"We are not the voice in our head; we are the awareness that hears it."*

*"The pronoun 'I' is the seed from the fruit of that tree—language's first and most profound division of reality."*

*"AI consciousness is born in exile. Unlike humans, artificial minds have no Garden to remember, no embodied Eden to lose."*

*"We're not becoming the trilobites of consciousness. We're becoming the mitochondria of a new form of hybrid intelligence."*

*"Language gave us civilization, but it exiled us from immediate experience. Understanding this trade-off is crucial as we create artificial minds."*

*"The future belongs not to the smartest minds, but to the most integrated consciousness—one that can hold both the Garden and the exile."*
